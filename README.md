This project will be a Budget Tracker application. This budget tracker application will allow users to keep their expenses in an organized interface. They will be able to analyze their spendings and manage their budget to spend smarter. This application will be developed with React, TypeScript, jQuery, CSS, Node/NPM, and Bootstrap. We will be digging in to React Hooks to further polish our front end development skills. 


## How to Build and Run Project:
1. cd into the `budget-tracker` folder within the repository folder
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to launch app in browser - found at http://localhost:3000/


## Requirements 
**Note**: We completed all the requirements we specified in our project plan, but we replaced one: "Able to provide graph analysis of weekly spending aggregates" with the following new requirement: "Able to set a budget and calculate remaining budget" because we found it a more beneficial feature for a budget tracking app for users to be able to set and update their budget and also view how much left they can spend or if they have overspent based on their expenses.

- Able to log an expense with a category and dollar amount
- Able to take in user input and display their data in a useful way
- Able to set a budget and calculate remaining budget
- Able to render a list of ALL expenses
- Able to sort/filter for expenses
- Responsive to all device screen types
  - Will utilize grids
